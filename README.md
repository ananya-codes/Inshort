# Inshort
Cash Flow Manager

In our college we commute through cabs daily, after week paying all the pending splits one by one becomes redundant
and tedious task. Inshort tells the payment method by which total cash flow among all the friends is minimized.

IT IS CURRENTLY IN FIRST PHASE.
basic UI is used.
